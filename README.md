# GTE-Financial-Internship
A collection of projects I worked on as an intern at GTE Financial during the summer of 2015

osi_swap.bat

This is a batch file I was asked to create which enables the selection of three different OSI environments.
The three environments include a test, a development, and a training environment. These allow specific types of users to
modify files in their specific OSI environments without modifying the main system used by the credit union.

No_Member_Number.sql

At GTE Financial, each member (customer) that visits a branch must have their member number recorded by an employee.
This is a SQL query which outputs the amount of member visits received from each GTE branch where a member number was not 
recorded by an employee. The date range can also be modified.

Mobile App Screenshots

I came up with an innovative mobile banking strategy for GTE Financial which included a mobile app. I made these mock-ups by 
using the online software Atomic.io while it was in a free beta. My idea was to implement an adaptive user interface using 
a dynamic tile interface and including an automatically personalized home screen. I presented my ideas to the executive board
and the strategy is scheduled to be implemented by October 2016.
